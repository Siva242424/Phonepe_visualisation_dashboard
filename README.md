# Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The process involves several key steps, including data extraction, transformation, database insertion, dashboard creation, and data retrieval.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

### 1. Data Extraction

The data extraction process involves scripting to clone the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository and collect the necessary data. This step ensures that the latest and relevant data is obtained for analysis.

### 2. Data Transformation

Python and Pandas are used for data transformation. This step focuses on cleaning and structuring the raw data, making it suitable for analysis and visualization.

### 3. Database Insertion

Transformed data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for efficient and organized data management. This step enables easy retrieval and updates to the dashboard.

### 4. Dashboard Creation

Using Streamlit and Plotly, an interactive dashboard is created to visualize the Phonepe Pulse data. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and interpreting the insights derived from the data.

### 5. Data Retrieval

Data retrieval involves fetching information from the PostgreSQL database to dynamically update the created dashboard. This ensures that the dashboard reflects the most recent data and allows for real-time analysis.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phonepe-pulse-data-viz.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the data extraction and transformation scripts:
   ```
   python extract_transform_data.py
   ```

4. Set up the PostgreSQL database and configure connection parameters in `config.py`.

5. Run the database insertion script:
   ```
   python insert_into_database.py
   ```

6. Launch the interactive dashboard:
   ```
   streamlit run dashboard.py
   ```
